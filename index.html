  <div>
  <p> My full name is Taggert Joseph Sawick, I am a second year here at the University of Georgia.
    I was born in Georgia and I'm twenty years old. Before UGA, I attended Allatoona High School in Acworth, Georgia were me and my family live.
    My family consists of an older brother Jake, a little sister London, a mother Michelle, and father Michael. I also have two dogs Mia and Gigi.

      <p> Here at UGA I am a Mathematics major and intend to also get a certificate in actuarial science. Right now, I'm in five classes including this and the lab.
        I lived in Creswell Hall my first year and currently live in The Mark. I really enjoy attending UGA and living in Athens. There is
        so much to do around the city and a lot of good food. One of my favorite things about this school is the sports. I love going to football
        and basketball games here and seeing our teams play.
        Click "UGA Athletics" too see what's going on with our teams.

        <p> Some things I like to do in my free time are hangout with friends, go to the movies, and spend time with my family.
          At the Mark I live with three of my best friends from home, Nick, Jack, and Connor, who also go to UGA. Jack is a Business Marketing major, Nick is a General Business major,
          and Connor is a Political Science major. We all are part of the same friend group here, so we all get along pretty well and have a lot of the same interests. I really enjoy living
          with them and couldn't imagine living with a different group.
